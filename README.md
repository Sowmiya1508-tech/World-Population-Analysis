# 🌍 World Population Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global population trends using Python.
This project explores how different population metrics interact and what they 
reveal about countries worldwide.

## 🔍 What I Analyzed
- Population size & density
- Growth rate vs. net population increase
- Urbanization patterns
- Land area vs. population concentration

## 💡 Key Insights
- India has surpassed China as the most populated country
- Fastest-growing countries are NOT the most populated ones
- Net increase is more meaningful than growth rate alone
- Land area has little relation to population size
- High urbanization doesn't directly drive population growth

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

- ## 📊 Visualizations
